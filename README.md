# AR-React Starter

This project is a starter kit for Arweave dApps using React, a starter kit can help developers get a jump start in building applications, but they also can have differing options so their is a balance of trade offs. This starter kit starts from `CreateReactApp` and adds some `Arweave` libraries and demonstrates how to connect to a wallet. You may want more, if so, and you think it is a good fit for this project, please post an issue and submit a PR.
